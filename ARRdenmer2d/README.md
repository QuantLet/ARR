Datafile: 'ARRdata.csv - The data set contains different researcher (3218 rows) of either RePEc (77 columns), Handelsblatt (48 columns) ranking or both and their Google Scholar data (16 columns) as well as age and subject fields (2 columns)'

Output: 'Contour plots of the kernel density of HB and GS (left), GS and RP (center), as well as HB and RP (right). The contour lines indicate the height of the density. Here the data of 84 researchers from 2015 is analyzed.'
