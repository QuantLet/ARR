Datafile: ARRdata.csv - The data set contains different researcher (3218 rows) of either RePEc (77 columns), Handelsblatt (48 columns) ranking or both and their Google Scholar data (16 columns) as well as age and subject fields (2 columns)

Output: Contour plot of the kernel density estimate of HB, RP and GS at three different levels of the density: 0.001 (green), 0.1 (red) and 0.75 (blue). Here the data of 84 researchers from 2015 is analyzed
